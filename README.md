Emotion Detection

This repository contains code and resources for building an emotion detection system using machine learning techniques. The system can identify and classify emotions from text, audio, or image data.

Overview

Emotion detection is the process of identifying human emotions from various data sources like text, speech, and images. This project leverages machine learning models to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust.

Features

Text Emotion Detection: Analyze text data to detect emotions.
Audio Emotion Detection: Analyze speech data to detect emotions.
Image Emotion Detection: Analyze facial expressions to detect emotions.
Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained models for quick and easy implementation.
Custom Training: Train your own models with provided datasets.
